# Enhancing-Network-Security-with-Machine-Learning-Based-Intrusion-Detection-System

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats effectively.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project are:
- **UNSW-NB15 Training Set**: `/content/UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv`
- **UNSW-NB15 Testing Set**: `/content/UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv`

These datasets contain a comprehensive set of network traffic features and are widely used for evaluating IDS systems.

## Features
- Implementation of feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
- Model training and evaluation using Random Forest Classifier.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, etc.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook IntrusionDetection.ipynb
   ```

## Results
- Comprehensive analysis of the datasets.
- Feature selection improved model performance significantly.
- Random Forest Classifier achieved high accuracy in detecting intrusions.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
